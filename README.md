#Day45 of #100DaysChallenge

Hey everyone!

I apologize for being late today. I'll do my best to be punctual in the future. Today's task was building a Carousel. The process was a bit intense, but seeing it all come together was definitely rewarding.

Technologies Used:
#HTML
#CSS
#JavaScript

Here's what I tackled:

✅ Drag & Swipe Navigation: Users can smoothly navigate through team members by dragging the carousel or using swipe gestures (mobile friendly!).

✅ Responsive Design: The layout adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a great experience on all devices.

✅ Clean and Modern Design: The carousel features rounded corners and subtle shadows for a visually appealing look.

It’s been an incredible journey, and I’m loving every second of it!
